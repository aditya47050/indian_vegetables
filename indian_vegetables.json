        "name": "Potato Beetle",
        "description": "The potato beetle, also known as the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), is a common pest of potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. These beetles are orange-yellow with black stripes on their wings, and their larvae are reddish with black spots. Both adults and larvae feed voraciously on plant foliage, leading to significant crop damage.",
        "symptoms": "Plants infested with potato beetles may exhibit defoliation, starting with small holes in leaves and progressing to complete leaf loss. Severe infestations can weaken plants, reduce yields, and even cause plant death. Clusters of orange eggs may be visible on the undersides of leaves.",
        "treatment": "Handpick beetles and larvae from plants and destroy them. Use floating row covers to prevent beetles from reaching plants. Apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad-based insecticides for organic control. Introduce natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings to reduce beetle populations. Crop rotation and removing plant debris at the end of the season can help disrupt their lifecycle.",

        "name": "Wireworms",
        "description": "Wireworms are the larvae of click beetles and are known for their hard, elongated bodies that resemble wires. They primarily target the roots and underground stems of plants, including potatoes, carrots, corn, and wheat. Wireworms can survive in the soil for several years, making them a persistent pest in agricultural and garden settings.",
        "symptoms": "Plants infested with wireworms may exhibit poor germination, stunted growth, and wilting. Upon inspection, roots and tubers may have small, round holes caused by wireworm feeding. In severe cases, the damage can lead to secondary infections and plant death.",
        "treatment": "Practice crop rotation to reduce wireworm populations in the soil. Use bait traps, such as buried pieces of potato, to monitor and capture wireworms. Apply beneficial nematodes to the soil to target larvae. Avoid planting susceptible crops in fields with a known wireworm history, and consider soil treatments with approved insecticides for severe infestations.",

Spray infested plants with a strong stream of water to dislodge aphids. Apply neem oil or insecticidal soap for organic control.
